## Lessons I learned from this assignment

#### Building a site from scratch using Bootstrap

* Using Bootstrap just to get the basic framework down saved me A LOT of time. It enabled me to focus more of my time and efforts on making sure the API worked and pulled in the correct information.
* I was able to later customize any css that I wanted to later on
* Here's a look at what the site looked like using only Bootstrap:
